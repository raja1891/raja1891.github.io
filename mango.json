            "description": "Mangoes are believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica were domesticated separately in South Asia and Southeast Asia over centuries, resulting in two distinct genetic populations in modern mangoes – the 'Indian type' and the 'Southeast Asian type'."

            "title": "Uses",
            "description": "The tree is more known for its fruit rather than for its timber. However, mango trees can be converted to lumber once their fruit-bearing lifespan has finished. The wood is susceptible to damage from fungi and insects.[16] The wood is used for musical instruments such as ukuleles,[16] plywood and low-cost furniture."
